# Scribbles

Source files for future blog to be created with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) in [Python](https://www.python.org/). 

### Datasets

Blog posts state the provenance of datasets used. 

For data that I personally assembled (through scraping, an API, etc.), see the [datasets]() folder for the code and csv.
